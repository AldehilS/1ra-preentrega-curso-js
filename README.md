# JavaScript Course Deliveries - Coderhouse

Here is the source code for my deliveries for the JavaScript course at Coderhouse. I developed a task list program where tasks can be added, listed, and deleted.

## First Delivery

The basic logic of the program was created. Through alerts and prompts, the user can access and modify their task list, and user inputs are validated.

## Second Delivery

The code was modified to replace the main menu from a string to an object, improving the code's scalability by allowing menu options to be added and modified, as well as being able to display it in different ways (such as a future graphical interface). The code was also modified to replace the array of task strings with an array of task objects. Each of these objects stores specific properties of the tasks to enrich the information that can be obtained.
